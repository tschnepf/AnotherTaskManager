- Notes/blockers:
  - Local `trivy` was not preinstalled; installed to `.tools/bin/trivy`.
  - API host port `8000` conflict encountered locally; resolved by removing host binding for `api` service in Compose.
  - JWT warning about short secret key remains in test/local context due default placeholder secret.
